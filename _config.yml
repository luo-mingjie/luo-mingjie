about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am an M.D. candidate at School of Medicine, Tsinghua University. Currently, I am doing clinical practicing at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), China. 

  I am interested in translational biomedical research and solving clinical problems using artiﬁcial intelligence. I have been working on computational methods for the identiﬁcation of biomarkers for patients’ responses to anti-cancer reagents. I have developed a screening platform to identify therapeutic targets for treating cancer patients based on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. I am using data mining strategies to analyze large scale electrical medical records.

  I am expecting to earn my M.D. degree in June 2022, and I am looking for post-doc positions on biomedical research.

  I have a B.S. from Tsinghua University and an M.A. from University of Melbourne. I worked with Prof. David Huang from Department of Cancer and Haematology and Prof. Terry Speed from Department of Bioinformatics, the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. My researches focus on translational cancer research, large scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening and computational methods for predicting responses for anti-cancer treatments. During my undergraduate, I worked with Prof. Li Wu and Prof. Xuegong Zhang on immunology and bioinformatics at Tsinghua University.
